# add-mp3-to-phone-call

Set up an automated phone call that will call your users with an MP3.

## Pre-requisites

### Environment variables

This project requires some environment variables to be set. A file named `.env` is used to store the values for those environment variables. To keep your tokens and secrets secure, make sure to not commit the `.env` file in git. When setting up the project with `twilio serverless:init ...` the Twilio CLI will create a `.gitignore` file that excludes `.env` from the version history.

In your `.env` file, set the following values:

| Variable | Description | Required |
| :Twilio:AccountSid | :Twilio Account SID from the dashboard | :true||
| :Twilio:AuthToken | :Twilio Auth Token from the dashboard | :true||
| :Twilio:PhoneNumber | :Twilio outgoing number | :true| |
| :ReceivingNumber | :Number to receive the call | :true|
